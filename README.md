ScheduleBuilder
===============

This repository is currently conflicted.

To begin, the repository contains one useful script for computer science students at Drexel to find when a certain class tends to be offered, getTermsForClass.py. This script is useful for building computer science plans of study. This script pings Drexel's term master schedule page every time it is run and works only for classes with the CS designation.

It also contains a script which is to be used to scrape information from Drexel's more robust (than the term master schedule, that is) Drexel One system, which contains much more information. Please ignore the not-quite-elegance of this script, because it should, hopefully, be a one-off solution. It is nearing completion.
